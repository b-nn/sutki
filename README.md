if you have a good idea, dm me on discord (lannabann) or open a pull request and I'll happily include it (as long as it doesn't fuck the codebase)
current todo list:
add tier 2 challenges
add golden strawberries (only given by tier 2 challenges)
refactor modules into structs
move all the `cat_prices` `automator_interval` etc. into their respective structs
