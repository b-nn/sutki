# sutki
open-source idle game
if you have a good idea, dm me on discord (lannabann) or open a pull request and I'll happily include it (as long as it doesn't fuck the codebase)
current todo list:
1. add tier 2 challenges
2. add golden strawberries (only given by tier 2 challenges)
3. refactor modules into structs
4. move all the `cat_prices` `automator_interval` etc. into their respective structs

ps: if you want to make a pull request, please follow the following 3 guidelines:
- have good code (self-explanatory)
- keep them small
- avoid comments, your code should be readable by itself
